  "description": "The laboratory has a written quality management (QM) program.",
  "note": "There must be a document that describes the overall QM program. The document need not be detailed, but should spell out the objectives and essential elements of the QM program. The QM program may be based upon some reference resource such as CLSI QMS01-04; the ISO 9000 series or ISO 15189; AABB's quality program; CAP's quality management publications; or it may be of the laboratory's own design. If the laboratory is part of a larger organization, the laboratory QM program is coordinated with the organization's QM program."
